Idea: "Teacher's Assistant: AI-Powered Classroom Tool"  Synopsis: Develop an AI-powered application designed to assist teachers with classroom management and student engagement. The tool will provide features that help teachers create quizzes, track student progress, manage assignments, and communicate with students.

- Quizzes to test understanding of content and provide students with detailed feedback to help them improve.
- Personalised study schedule - AI can help students create study plans based on their individual learning pace, deadlines, and goals.
